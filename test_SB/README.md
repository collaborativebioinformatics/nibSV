  testNib_seq_N.fa: Reference sequence (10kbp region of human genome)
  outN.fasta: Simulated SV (generated using SURVIVOR)
  outN.fasta_x.fasta: simulated paired-end illumina reads of outN.fasta (using mason)
  outN.bam, outN_sorted.bam and outN.cram are generated by mapping simulated illumina reads to Reference sequence (using BWA)
