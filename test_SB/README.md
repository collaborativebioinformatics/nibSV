  1. testNib_seq_N.fa: Reference sequence (10kbp region of human genome)
  
  2. outN.fasta and outN.vcf: Simulated SV (generated using SURVIVOR)
  
  3. outN.fasta_x.fasta: Simulated paired-end illumina reads of outN.fasta (using mason)
  
  4. outN_sorted.bam and outN.cram are generated by mapping simulated illumina reads to Reference sequence (using BWA)
